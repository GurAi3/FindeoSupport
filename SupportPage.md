# Findeo Support

Welcome to the official support page for the Findeo app. We're here to help you get the most out of your video search experience.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. What is Findeo?**

Findeo is a simple and powerful application designed to help you search for videos quickly, manage a list of your favorites, and keep track of your recent searches, all in one clean interface.

**2. Where is my data (favorites and search history) stored?**

Your privacy is our top priority. All of your data, including your search history and your list of favorite videos, is stored **locally on your device only**. We do not have access to your data, and it is never uploaded to any server or shared with any third parties.

**3. How do I add a video to my favorites?**

When you find a video you like in the search results, simply tap the star icon (â˜…) next to the video title. It will be automatically saved to your Favorites list for easy access later.

**4. How can I delete an item from my search history or favorites?**

In both the "Recent Searches" and "Favorites" lists, you can delete an item by swiping left on it. A "Delete" button will appear, allowing you to remove it permanently.
